# SIMPLE EMAIL TIMING FIX - USE SUPABASE CRON INSTEAD

## The Problem
We've wasted weeks fighting with Vercel's unreliable cron system. Time to use a proper solution.

## The Simple Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Setup Supabase Cron Job
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Run the contents of `setup-supabase-cron.sql`
3. This creates a reliable cron job at 11:00 UTC (7:00 AM EDT)

### Step 2: Disable Vercel Cron (Optional)
Edit `vercel.json` to remove the unreliable Vercel cron:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Test
- Wait until tomorrow 7 AM Eastern
- Emails should arrive at correct time
- Check Supabase logs if needed

## Why This Will Work
- **Supabase cron is reliable** - designed for database operations
- **Direct function call** - no HTTP requests through Vercel
- **Proper timezone handling** - Supabase runs on UTC consistently
- **Battle-tested** - used by thousands of production apps

## Rollback Plan
If this doesn't work, the issue is deeper in the email sending logic, not the scheduling.

## Expected Result
Emails arrive at 7:00 AM Eastern Time consistently every day.

This should have been the solution from day 1.
