## üîÑ Development Workflow & Best Practices

### 1. Development Process
```
Local Development (localhost:5173)
    ‚Üì
Testing in Dev Environment
    ‚Üì
Commit to Git
    ‚Üì
Push to GitHub
    ‚Üì
Auto-Deploy to Vercel (both projects)
    ‚Üì
Production Testing on goalmine.ai
```

### 2. Development Best Practices

#### Always Work in Dev First
- Make ALL changes in local development environment
- Test thoroughly at localhost:5173
- Never edit production directly

#### Testing Protocol
1. **Before Committing**: Run full test suite locally
2. **Build Test**: `npm run build` must succeed without errors
3. **Manual Testing**: Complete the testing checklist below
4. **Commit with Clear Messages**: Describe what was fixed/added

#### Git Workflow
```bash
# 1. Check status
git status

# 2. Add all changes
git add -A

# 3. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix: [specific issue] - [what was done]"

# 4. Push to GitHub (triggers auto-deploy)
git push origin main
```
