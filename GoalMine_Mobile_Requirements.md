Click "New Chat" and use this **exact prompt**:

```
I need to build a mobile-native GoalMine.ai Progressive Web App (PWA) as a completely separate project from the existing web application. This will share the same backend infrastructure but be optimized specifically for mobile devices with native-like capabilities.

PROJECT ISOLATION REQUIREMENTS:
- This is a COMPLETELY SEPARATE project from the existing GoalMine.ai web app
- New project directory: ~/GoalMine-Mobile-App
- Different port: localhost:5174 (web app uses 5173)
- Separate repository for independent development
- DO NOT reference any files from other GoalMine projects

MOBILE-NATIVE REQUIREMENTS:
I have a complete mobile requirements document that specifies:
- Advanced Progressive Web App with native-like experience
- Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications (replacing email system)
- Gesture-based interactions (swipe to check-in, pull to refresh)
- Offline-first architecture with background sync
- Context-aware AI notifications (smart timing, location awareness)
- Touch-optimized UI with haptic feedback
- Bottom navigation tab structure
- Mobile-specific user flows and micro-interactions

SHARED BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE:
- Firebase Authentication: [paste your Firebase config]
- Supabase Database: [paste your Supabase config]  
- OpenAI GPT-4 Integration: [paste your OpenAI key]
- Use existing edge functions and database schema

TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS:
- Framework: React + TypeScript + Vite
- PWA: Vite PWA plugin + Workbox for advanced service worker
- Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging
- UI: Mobile-optimized component library (shadcn-ui adapted for mobile)
- Gestures: Touch event handling optimized for mobile
- Offline: IndexedDB + Background Sync
- Animations: Framer Motion for smooth mobile animations

DEVELOPMENT SETUP NEEDED:
1. Initialize React + TypeScript + Vite project
2. Configure advanced PWA with service worker
3. Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging
4. Install mobile-optimized dependencies
5. Create mobile-first project structure
6. Configure environment variables for mobile-specific features

FIRST PHASE DELIVERABLES:
- Complete project setup with PWA configuration
- Mobile-optimized authentication flow
- Basic bottom navigation structure (Today, Goals, Progress, Profile)
- Push notification permission flow
- Offline-first data architecture foundation

Please confirm you understand these requirements and start by setting up the complete mobile project structure. Ask me any clarifying questions before beginning.
```

## **PHASE 3: GUIDED DEVELOPMENT PROCESS**

### **Step 5: Claude Code Will Ask Follow-Up Questions**
Be prepared to provide:

**A. Mobile Requirements Document:**
```
Claude will ask for detailed requirements. Respond:
"I have a complete mobile requirements document. Let me share the key specifications..."

Then copy/paste the key sections from this document:
- Mobile-native UI architecture (Part IV)
- Push notification system requirements (Part V)
- Offline-first functionality (Part VI)
- Gesture control specifications (Part VII)
- Context-aware AI features (Part III)
```

**B. Existing Backend Integration:**
```
Claude will ask about backend integration. Respond:
"The mobile app should use the existing GoalMine.ai backend infrastructure:
- Same Supabase edge functions
- Same database schema
- Same Firebase authentication
- BUT with mobile-specific optimizations for push notifications and offline sync"
```

**C. Design Preferences:**
```
Claude will ask about UI design. Respond:
"Use the same brand colors and general aesthetic as the web app, but optimized for mobile:
- Bottom tab navigation instead of top header
- Larger touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Thumb-friendly layouts
- Gesture-based interactions as primary UI pattern
- Pull-to-refresh and swipe actions throughout"
```

### **Step 6: Monitor Initial Setup**
Claude Code will:
1. ✅ Initialize the React + TypeScript + Vite project
2. ✅ Install all mobile-specific dependencies  
3. ✅ Configure PWA with advanced service worker
4. ✅ Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging
5. ✅ Create mobile-first component structure
6. ✅ Configure environment variables

**Your checkpoint**: Verify the project runs at `localhost:5174` with no errors

## **🎯 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **Key Reminders for Development:**

1. **Project Isolation**: Keep mobile project completely separate from web app
2. **Mobile-First Mindset**: Don't port web patterns - design for mobile from ground up
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work offline, enhanced features when online
4. **Performance First**: Mobile users expect instant responses and smooth animations
5. **Battery Conscious**: Optimize for minimal battery drain with smart background processing

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- ❌ **Don't copy/paste from web app** - build mobile-optimized components
- ❌ **Don't ignore touch targets** - minimum 44px for all interactive elements  
- ❌ **Don't assume fast internet** - design for 3G networks
- ❌ **Don't neglect offline state** - gracefully handle connection issues
- ❌ **Don't skip real device testing** - simulators don't show real performance
