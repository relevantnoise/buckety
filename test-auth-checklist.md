# 🔥 Firebase Authentication Testing Checklist

## 🌐 Access the App
1. Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8081/**
2. You should see the GoalMine.ai authentication page

## 📋 Testing Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Check Firebase Initialization
1. **Open browser Developer Tools** (F12 or Right-click → Inspect)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Look for**: `🔥 Firebase initialized via CDN`
4. **Look for**: `🔥 Firebase CDN integration ready!`

**Expected Result**: Both messages should appear without errors

### ✅ Step 2: Test Email/Password Sign-Up
1. **Click the "Sign Up" tab**
2. **Fill in**:
   - Full Name: `Test Firebase User`
   - Email: `test@firebase.goalmine.com` (use a test email)
   - Password: `test123456`
3. **Click "Create Account"**

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Loading spinner appears
- ✅ User gets signed in automatically
- ✅ Redirected to main app dashboard
- ✅ Console shows authentication success

---

### ✅ Step 3: Check User Profile Creation
1. **Open a new tab**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Go to your project** → Table Editor → `profiles` table
3. **Look for the new user**:
   - Email: `test@firebase.goalmine.com`
   - `clerk_uuid`: Should contain Firebase UID
   - `trial_expires_at`: Should be 30 days from now

**Expected Result**: New user profile automatically created

### ✅ Step 4: Test Sign Out & Sign In
1. **Sign out** from the app (if there's a logout button)
2. **Or refresh** the page to get back to auth screen
3. **Go to "Sign In" tab**
4. **Use same credentials**:
   - Email: `test@firebase.goalmine.com`
   - Password: `test123456`
5. **Click "Sign In"**

**Expected Result**: Successfully signs in to existing account

---

### ✅ Step 5: Test Google Sign-In
1. **Sign out** again (or use incognito window)
2. **Click "Continue with Google" button**
3. **Complete Google OAuth flow**

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Google popup appears
- ✅ Google sign-in completes
- ✅ User gets signed in
- ✅ New Google user profile created in Supabase

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Firebase doesn't initialize:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify internet connection (Firebase loads from CDN)
- Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+F5)

### If Google Sign-In fails:
1. You need to enable it in Firebase Console:
   - Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/project/goalmineai
   - Authentication → Sign-in methods → Google
   - Toggle "Enable"
   - Add your domain: `localhost`

### If errors occur:
1. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Check network tab** for failed requests
3. **Verify Firebase config** is correct in page source
