# ðŸŽ¯ Clean SaaS Project Blueprint
**Universal Template for Any SaaS Application**

## The Exact Prompt to Give Claude Code

```
I want you to build a complete, production-ready SaaS application with the exact specifications below. 

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Build this as a COMPLETE, WORKING application - not a prototype
2. Use the EXACT tech stack specified - no substitutions
3. Implement ALL authentication flows completely (including email verification)
4. Test EVERY feature as you build it - fix issues immediately
5. Create a fully working subscription system with proper limits
6. Set up professional email delivery with proper templates
7. Deploy to production and verify everything works end-to-end

âœ… TESTING CRITERIA:  
- Free users hit limits and see upgrade prompts
- Premium users can access all features
- Subscription status updates immediately after payment
- Webhook properly updates database when subscriptions change
- Trial expiration properly restricts access
```

#### **Core Application Features**
```
[DEFINE EACH FEATURE WITH:]

FEATURE: [FEATURE NAME]
PURPOSE: [WHAT IT DOES]
USER FLOW: [STEP BY STEP USER EXPERIENCE]
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: [SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION NEEDS]
BUSINESS RULES: [ANY RESTRICTIONS OR LOGIC]
TESTING CRITERIA: [HOW TO VERIFY IT WORKS]

REPEAT FOR EACH MAJOR FEATURE...
```

```

#### **Database Schema**
```
PROVIDE EXACT SCHEMA FOR YOUR APP:

- email (text, unique)
- created_at (timestamp)
- trial_expires_at (timestamp, default: created_at + 30 days)
- subscription_tier (text, default: 'free')

[ADD YOUR APP-SPECIFIC TABLES HERE]
```

#### **Edge Functions Required**
```
LIST EVERY FUNCTION NEEDED FOR YOUR APP:

1. create-user-profile
