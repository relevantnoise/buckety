Use this template to crystallize your idea:

```markdown
APP CONCEPT WORKSHEET

App Name: _________________
One-sentence purpose: "Helps [target users] [accomplish what] [better than alternatives]"
Target Users: [Be specific - demographics, pain points, willingness to pay]
Business Model: $[X]/month for [specific value proposition]
Unique Hook: [What makes this different from existing solutions?]

Example:
- App Name: MealPlan Pro
- Purpose: "Helps busy parents create healthy meal plans that kids will actually eat"
- Users: Working parents, ages 28-45, household income $75k+, value time over money
- Business Model: $19/month for personalized meal plans + grocery lists + kid-friendly recipes
- Hook: AI learns your family's actual eating preferences, not just dietary restrictions
```

### **Step 2: Map Your Core Features** 
Be ruthlessly specific about MVP vs. future features:

```markdown
MVP FEATURES (Launch Requirements):
1. [Primary feature] - Users can [specific action] resulting in [specific value]
2. [Secondary feature] - Users can [specific action] to [accomplish goal]
3. [Essential feature] - System automatically [does what] when [trigger]

FUTURE FEATURES (Post-Launch):
- [Nice to have features that can wait]
- [Advanced features for power users]
- [Integrations and partnerships]
```

### **Hybrid Architecture Pattern (Critical for Scalability)**

As your app evolves, you'll need to support different data formats. Here's the pattern:

```typescript
// Hybrid User ID Support Pattern
interface HybridLookup {
  // Support both email-based and UID-based records
  findUserGoals: (userIdentifier: string) => {
    if (userIdentifier.includes('@')) {
      // Legacy email-based lookup
      return await query.eq('user_id', userIdentifier);
    } else {
      // New UID-based lookup  
      return await query.eq('user_id', userIdentifier);
    }
  }
}

// Auto-detection pattern for email systems
const detectDataFormat = (userId: string) => {
  return userId.includes('@') ? 'email-based' : 'uid-based';
};
```

---

## üé® **PART IV: SOPHISTICATED BUSINESS LOGIC PATTERNS**

### **The Expired States System (Enterprise-Grade)**

Every SaaS needs sophisticated handling of expired scenarios:

```typescript
// Business Logic Hierarchy
enum BusinessState {
  TRIAL_EXPIRED = 'trial_expired',      // Highest priority
  GOAL_EXPIRED = 'goal_expired',        // Medium priority  
  NORMAL = 'normal'                     // Default state
}

// Permission Matrix
interface PermissionMatrix {
  trial_expired: {
    create: false,
    read: true,     // Can view existing data
    update: false,  // Until upgrade
    delete: false,
    share: false,
    email: false
  },
  goal_expired: {
    create: true,   // Can create new goals
    read: true,
    update: true,   // Can extend date
    delete: true,   // Can clean up
    share: false,   // No sharing expired goals
    email: false    // No emails for expired goals
  }
}
```

### **Status-Based UI Pattern**

```typescript
// Visual Status System
interface StatusBadge {
  trial_expired: {
    badge: "TRIAL EXPIRED",
    color: "orange",
    action: "Upgrade to continue",
    component: <UpgradePrompt />
  },
  goal_expired: {
    badge: "GOAL EXPIRED", 
    color: "red",
    action: "Extend date or delete",
    component: <ExtendDateDialog />
  }
}
```
