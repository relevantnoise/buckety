## 💬 PART 3: THE PERFECT CLAUDE CODE PROMPT
**Use This Exact Message to Start Your Project**

```
I need you to build a complete, production-ready SaaS application. This is a REAL project that needs to work perfectly, not a prototype or demo.

PROJECT ISOLATION:
- Create a new folder: /Users/[yourname]/[your-app-name]/
- This is COMPLETELY SEPARATE from any other projects
- Do not reference or use ANY files from other directories
- Start everything fresh

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Build a COMPLETE, WORKING application - test everything as you go
2. Use the EXACT tech stack specified - no substitutions
3. If something doesn't work, STOP and fix it before continuing
4. Every feature must be production-ready
5. Deploy to production and verify everything works

TECH STACK (MANDATORY):
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn-ui
- Auth: Firebase (CDN version) synced with Supabase profiles
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL with Edge Functions
- Email: Resend (not Firebase for app emails)
- Payments: Stripe with subscription management
- Hosting: Vercel with custom domain

HERE ARE MY SERVICE CREDENTIALS:
[Paste all your credentials from Step 1]

HERE IS MY COMPLETE APP SPECIFICATION:
[Paste your filled-out specification from Part 2]

DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:
1. Set up the complete project structure
2. Implement authentication with email verification
3. Create the database schema and edge functions
4. Build each feature completely before moving to the next
5. Test everything thoroughly
6. Deploy to production

If any component fails or doesn't work perfectly:
- Debug it immediately
- Don't move forward until it's fixed
- Test the fix thoroughly

Start by confirming you understand these requirements, then begin building the application step by step.
```

SOLUTION: Ensure edge function is deployed
         Check Supabase RLS policies
         Verify service role key is used
```

### Database Pitfalls & Solutions
```
PROBLEM: Can't write to database

         Never write directly from frontend
         Check RLS policies

PROBLEM: Data doesn't appear
SOLUTION: Check if using correct user_id
         Verify foreign key relationships
         Look at Supabase logs

PROBLEM: Edge functions fail
SOLUTION: Check function logs in Supabase
         Verify environment variables
         Test with curl first
```

### Subscription Pitfalls & Solutions
```
PROBLEM: Limits not enforced
SOLUTION: Always check on backend, not just frontend
         Refresh subscription status regularly
         Handle edge cases explicitly

PROBLEM: Webhooks don't fire
SOLUTION: Verify webhook URL is correct
         Check Stripe webhook settings
         Look at Stripe logs

PROBLEM: Trial logic broken
SOLUTION: Store trial_ends_at in database
         Calculate on backend, not frontend
         Handle timezone correctly
```

### Email Pitfalls & Solutions
```
PROBLEM: Emails go to spam
SOLUTION: Use proper from address

## 📝 FINAL NOTES FOR SUCCESS

### Remember These Key Principles:

1. **Complete Separation**: Each project lives in its own universe
2. **Test Everything**: If it's not tested, it's broken
3. **Fix Immediately**: Don't accumulate technical debt
4. **User First**: Every decision should improve user experience
5. **Document Everything**: Your future self will thank you

### When You Get Stuck:

1. **Check the logs** (Supabase, Vercel, browser console)
2. **Test in incognito mode** (eliminates cache issues)
3. **Verify credentials** (most issues are wrong keys)
4. **Read error messages carefully** (they usually tell you exactly what's wrong)
5. **Start fresh if needed** (sometimes a clean start is faster)

### Your Success Formula:

```
Clear Requirements + 
Correct Tech Stack + 
Systematic Development + 
Thorough Testing = 
Successful SaaS Launch
```
