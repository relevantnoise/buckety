# 🚀 Firebase Auth Production Deployment Plan

## Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Firebase Console Configuration
Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/project/goalmineai

**Authentication → Sign-in methods:**
- ✅ Enable **Email/Password**
- ✅ Enable **Google** 
  - Add authorized domain: `goalmine.ai`
  - Add authorized domain: `www.goalmine.ai` (if applicable)

**Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains:**
- ✅ Add `goalmine.ai`
- ✅ Add your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., `goalmine-ai-xyz123.vercel.app`)

### 2. Email Configuration (Optional but Recommended)
**Authentication → Templates:**
- Customize email verification template
- Customize password reset template
- Use your branding/domain

---

## Phase 2: Deploy to Production (2 minutes)

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/zaptitude/Downloads/steady-aim-coach-main

# Login to Vercel if needed
npx vercel login

# Deploy with Firebase environment variables
./deploy-firebase.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Sets all Firebase environment variables on Vercel
- Deploys the new Firebase auth code
- Updates goalmine.ai with Firebase authentication

---

## Phase 3: Full User Workflow Testing (15 minutes)

### Test 1: New User Email Sign-Up Flow
1. **Go to**: https://goalmine.ai
2. **Sign up** with a real email you control
3. **Check email** for verification (if enabled)
4. **Verify** where new users land in the app
5. **Check Supabase** - confirm user profile created
6. **Test goal creation** - ensure existing features work

### Test 2: Google Sign-Up Flow  
1. **Use incognito window**: https://goalmine.ai
2. **Sign up with Google**
3. **Verify** where Google users land
4. **Check Supabase** - confirm Google user profile
5. **Test app functionality**

### Test 3: Existing User Sign-In
1. **Sign out** from previous tests
2. **Sign in** with email/password
3. **Sign in** with Google account
4. **Verify** users land in the right place
5. **Test** that existing data/goals are preserved

### Test 4: Full User Journey
1. **Create a goal**
2. **Set up daily nudges**
3. **Test subscription flow** (if applicable)
4. **Verify email notifications** still work
5. **Test trial expiration** behavior
