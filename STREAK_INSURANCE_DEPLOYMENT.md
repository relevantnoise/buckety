# Streak Insurance System - Deployment Guide

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

The streak insurance system has been fully implemented with the following features:

### ✅ What's New
- **Streak Insurance**: Users earn 1 insurance day every 7 consecutive check-ins (max 3)
- **Automatic Recovery**: Insurance automatically protects streaks when days are missed
- **Planned Breaks**: Users can schedule breaks that preserve their streaks
- **Enhanced Notifications**: Smart toasts for insurance usage, earnings, and milestones
- **Visual Indicators**: Insurance display with tooltips and status indicators

### 📁 Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:
- `supabase/migrations/20250827_add_streak_insurance_system.sql` - Database schema
- `supabase/migrations/20250827_streak_insurance_function.sql` - Enhanced check-in function
- `src/components/StreakInsurance.tsx` - Insurance display component
- `src/components/PlannedBreakDialog.tsx` - Break scheduling component
- `STREAK_INSURANCE_DEPLOYMENT.md` - This guide

#### Modified Files:
- `src/hooks/useGoals.tsx` - Updated Goal interface and check-in logic
- `src/components/GoalCard.tsx` - Added insurance display and break dialog
- `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` - Updated database types

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migrations
```bash
# Run the migration files in order:
supabase db reset  # or apply migrations individually
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (if needed)
No new dependencies required - uses existing UI components.

### 3. Test the System

#### Database Testing:
```sql
-- Test the new function
SELECT handle_goal_checkin_with_recovery('goal-uuid', 'user-id');

-- Check new tables exist
SELECT * FROM streak_recoveries LIMIT 1;

-- Verify new columns
SELECT streak_insurance_days, is_on_planned_break FROM goals LIMIT 1;
```

#### Frontend Testing:
1. Create a new goal
2. Check in 7 times consecutively → Should earn 1 insurance day
3. Miss a day and check in → Insurance should protect streak
4. Try scheduling a planned break → Should show break dialog

## 🔍 How It Works

### Streak Insurance Logic:
1. **Earning**: Every 7 consecutive check-ins earns 1 insurance day (max 3)
2. **Usage**: Automatically consumed when days are missed
3. **Protection**: Covers up to the number of insurance days you have
4. **Recovery**: Tracks usage in `streak_recoveries` table

### Planned Breaks:
1. **Scheduling**: Users can plan breaks up to 14 days
2. **Protection**: Streaks are preserved during planned breaks
3. **Check-ins**: Blocked during break period
4. **Auto-resume**: Break status automatically cleared after end date

### Enhanced Notifications:
- **Insurance Used**: "🛡️ Streak Protected! Used X insurance days..."
- **Insurance Earned**: "🛡️ Streak Insurance Earned! You earned 1 insurance day..."
- **Streak Reset**: "💔 Streak Reset - Not enough insurance days..."
- **Regular Check-in**: "✅ Checked In! Your streak is now X days..."

## 🎨 UI Components

### StreakInsurance Component:
- Shows insurance count (X/3)
- Visual dots indicating insurance status
- Informative tooltip with protection details

### PlannedBreakDialog Component:
- Schedule breaks with date picker
- Shows break status when active
- Cancel break functionality
- Visual break indicator

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Earning Insurance
1. Check in for 7 consecutive days
2. Should see "Insurance Earned" notification
3. Insurance display should show 1/3

### Scenario 2: Using Insurance
1. Have at least 1 insurance day
2. Miss 1 day
3. Check in the next day
4. Should see "Streak Protected" notification
5. Streak should continue, insurance count should decrease

### Scenario 3: Planned Break
1. Click "Plan Break" button
2. Schedule 3-day break starting tomorrow
3. Goal card should show break status
4. Check-in should be blocked during break
5. After break ends, check-in should resume normally

### Scenario 4: Insufficient Insurance
1. Have 0 insurance days
2. Miss 1 day
3. Check in the next day
4. Should see "Streak Reset" notification
5. Streak should reset to 1

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Database:
- New columns have proper defaults (0 for insurance_days, false for is_on_planned_break)
- RLS policies are properly configured
- Foreign key constraints maintain data integrity

### Performance:
- Indexes added to streak_recoveries for better query performance
- Optimized queries in the database function
- Minimal frontend state changes

### Backwards Compatibility:
- Existing goals will work normally with 0 insurance days
- Old check-in function still exists (though not used)
- Gradual migration - users will earn insurance naturally

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Migration Errors**: Ensure proper permissions and existing table structure
2. **Type Errors**: Restart TypeScript language server after type updates
3. **Function Not Found**: Verify migration applied successfully
4. **UI Not Updating**: Clear browser cache and reload

### Debug Commands:
```sql
-- Check insurance status
SELECT id, title, streak_count, streak_insurance_days FROM goals WHERE user_id = 'user-id';

-- View recovery history
SELECT * FROM streak_recoveries WHERE user_id = 'user-id' ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Test function directly
SELECT handle_goal_checkin_with_recovery('goal-id', 'user-id');
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After deployment, monitor:
- Insurance earning rate (should align with 7-day streaks)
- Insurance usage frequency (indicates system is working)
- Streak recovery events (shows protection is active)
- User engagement with planned breaks
- Reduction in harsh streak resets

The system transforms the previous "all-or-nothing" approach into a supportive, forgiving system that still rewards consistency while acknowledging that life happens!

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

Ideas for future improvements:
1. **Streak Analytics Dashboard** - Visual charts of insurance usage
2. **Achievement Badges** - Reward milestones and insurance smart usage
3. **Social Features** - Share streak achievements with friends
4. **Advanced Break Types** - Sick leave, vacation modes with different rules
5. **Insurance Gifting** - Allow users to gift insurance days to friends
