## ⚠️ Documentation Debt Warnings

You have documentation debt if:
1. You have to explain the same thing twice
2. New team members are confused about something documented
3. You forget how something works and docs don't help
4. Production issues happen from outdated procedures
5. You say "oh, we changed that but didn't update the docs"

---

## 🚦 Quick Health Check

Ask yourself monthly:
1. Could a new developer start working with just the docs? ✓/✗
2. Do the deployment steps still work exactly as written? ✓/✗
3. Are all recent major changes documented? ✓/✗
4. Would I remember this in 6 months? ✓/✗

If any are ✗, schedule a documentation update session.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Update docs BEFORE you forget** - Details fade quickly
2. **Include the "why"** - Not just what changed, but why
3. **Real examples** - Include actual commands and code
4. **Date your updates** - Helps track what's recent
5. **Test your docs** - Try following them yourself
